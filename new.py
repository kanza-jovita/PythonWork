#More types of functions
#django is a web application package for people to develop appliaations
#how do we organise our code so that it can be reused.
#a folder is not called a folder but rather a directory.
#a file in python is called a script
#a file created within a directory and write your code in there is called a script.
#and is you want the script to be used it becomes a module and the directory becomes a package.
