#OOP-OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
#The steps on how to solve a problem is called an algorithm
#Our solution is structured in a top down approach and  that structure in software development is called structured programming.
#But that approach doesnt suit the real world scenarios because we want to create software thats related to the real world therefore that brought about object oriented programming
#OOp is a paradigm of software development that advocates for developing software based on real world objects.
#Things we interact with in OOP
#classes vs objects


#principles of OOP
    #polymorphism
    #Inheritance
    #Abstraction
    #Encapsulation

#a class is a blueprint of an object(the origanl copy of something)
#e.g class car has objects such a benz,toyota,range rovers,etc
#class phone has objects such a itel,nokia,samsung,iphone,etc.
#objects take on all features of a class but each object has different attributes /features of the class.

#an object is an instance of a class

#a class can have 10 varialbles each item that completes those 10 variables is complete and is called an object e.g we have a class,animal with attributes name, color, number of legs therefore a complete set of those values is called an object.

#we use "is a" to identify a class of an object e.g lake victoria 'is a' lake therfore lake is the class and lake victoria is the object.

#abstraction refers to ability to ignore other details and concentrate on the highest level of representation
#abstract helps in identifying classes
#class names are always in singular e.g class "car" not "cars"

#Inheritance
    #this where we have the concept of parent and child toyota is a chil of a car,samsung is a child of smartphone.
#inheritance is the ability by an object to take on different attributes from different classes for example toyota wish is belonging to a class toyota and a class car,subaru legacy is an instance belonging to subaru and class car
#we can have a class in a class


#Polymorphism
    #having the ability of an object to take on differnt forms/attrbutes hence polymorphism

#Encapsulation (privacy and independance)
    #the ability to have what to share and what not to share is what we call encapsulation
