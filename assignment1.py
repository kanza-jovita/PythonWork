#The following are what I learnt from  my python class.

# I learnt ;
#that a HardDrive  is where we store our instructions and 
#programming is the art and science of writing computer instructions.
#I learnt about the similarities between computers and  humans and that is the both store,both network,
#and both process information.
#The brain of a computer is the CPU.
#For us to program a computer,you have to understand the CPU  and the memory
#because they are synchronised and work hand in hand.
    

#I also learnt that;
#The memory of a computer is in different categories:
#Memory checked using optical light-which is called optical memeory for example DVD,CD and they are external memory.
#Electromagnetic fields/metallic which is  Hard Disk Drive
#Using copying that involves reading and writing to for example flash drive.
    
#I learnt that RAM is the secondary memory of a computer in that for example when i open a word document,
#RAM is being filled as i start writing and when i close it,it gets empty.

#I learnt that the CPU  cannot communicate directly with the hard drive reason being there is another
#memory in between called RAM.
#We also have another memory called buffer where work is stored temporarily.



#I learnt that the Hard Drive,
#reads from inner outwards
#rotates clockwise
#reads through electromagnetic fields through plugging in and that
#You cant use blank memeory so you have to partition it,Partitioning is creating physical spaces and giving the unique identifiers
#after partitioning,the unique identifier is loaded in the RAM.

#I learnt that  memory is structured in form of:
#Hard Disk
#RAM
#Buffer
#Registers


#I learnt about the types of memory
#cache which is memory that stores frequently used memory addresses

#RAM;
#for example when you have a game installed in you computer it goes to the hard disk,
#when you start playing it,its loaded to the RAM ,when you stop playing it goes back to the hard disk

#Buffer
#here is where files like word are brought

#PYTHON
#I got to know about the language python
#I learnt that python is a programming language that was created by Guieodo Vanrusom, a Dutch who lives in America
# and that python is managed by a foundation called PSF-python Software Foundation managed by Guieodo and represnted by Osman.

#I also got to know about how python came into existance,
#there was a langauge called C that was cretaed by Graham Bell-the firstv inventor of a telephone,it awas during
#a chrismas holiday(winter),vanrusom had improved the language C to AB,however it wasn't good enough so during the christmas evening,
#he was  too bored and started watching a comedy show called monte py,its from then that he got the call to improve
#AB which he called python.
#Python is used in google search,firefox,dropbox,instagram,youtube and most hackers use python to hack


#Why Python?
#Python is a fourth generation language
#It is object oriented
#It is multi purpose for example can be used in mobile app development,AI,data science,and data analysis.

#Pthon is an interepreted language while languaged like java,and C are compiled languages.languages

#The rules that govern the use of a programming language are caleed SYNTAX

#Programming is the art and science of writing statemnts
#Codes make up a program


#I learnt and understood what variables are;
#Variables are human readable names we add to addresses of the memory
#Variables can also be names programmers give to the memory spaces of the hard disk of the computer. 
#for example a+b are variables where a = 50 and b = 30,therefore the a and b are variables
#So in simple terms a variable is a named memory space

#I was also able to understand well these concepts;
#the variable syntax for python is # which represents a comment for readability
#comments in a program are as good as the code you are writing.
#variable names should not start with special charcaters e.g(#number,@,$)
#variable names should not start with a numerical number,e.g(1number)
#however,number2 is valid syntax
#a variable name should not have spacese.g(my age,this is wrong)
#composite variable names should be separated by an underscore e.g(my_age)
#or you can use camel-case notation e.g(myAge,myName)
#names should not start with capital letters unless they are functions or classes e.g(Myname)
#we should use relatable names e.g when dealing with a customer name,call them mycustomer,when dealing with numbers use num1,num2,num3)
#use shorter names e.g(cust for customer,num for number.age instead of my age,sal for salary)
#variable names should not be repeated in different forms because python is case sensitivee.g('Name' and 'name' are not the same)
#age = 23
#name = "jovita"
#school = "refactory"
#print(school)
#declaring variables is a process of giving a memory space a name.
#initialising a variable is the process of assigning a value to a variable e.g('age' is a variable,'26' is the value)
#animal = "Cow"
#the '=' sign is the assignment operator in programming language
#an equal sign is used to give a value to a variable


#I learnt about datatypes in Python
#Datatypes are differnt categories of content we store in the memory.
#we pay attention to data types because it helps us manage or storage efficiently so that we are not wasteful
#for example the space required to store umbers will not be the same space required to store a string.
#Thats why we put quotations on names and not numbers.


#these are the datatypes I got to know about;
#numeric
#Numeric-involves integers(int),float(float),complex numbers(complex)
#for examples
#num1=10
#print(num1, "is of a type", type(num1))
#num2=5.0
#print(num2, "is of a type",type(num2))
#num3=1+2j
#print(num3, "is of a type",type(num3))


#string
#strings-is a group of characters
#name="Jovita" #or'Jovita'

#sequence data type
#where we have lists,tuples and range
#lists is a mutable data type that can store more than one value

#mapping
#mapping-mapping category has a dictionary datatype.
#person={"name":"Jovita", "age":8, "country":"uganda","height":210}
#where by person is a dict
#print(person)
#print (person.keys())
#print(person.values())

#set
#set is unoredered collection of  unique values
#student_id={100,200,300,400,500,500}
#print(student_id)
#print(student_id)

#boolean



#I learnt what type casting is;
#type casting is changing one value of a datatype into another datatype
#it involves making the computer treate a certain data type into another
#for example
#numy=int(numx)
#print(numy,"is a type of",type(numy))
#numy=float(numx)
#print(numy,"is a type of",type(numy))


#Semantics refers to the meaning of what you have written

#tuples;
#tuples are read only elements
#tuples are not mutable
#tuples can store more than one data type

##indexing;
#for example
#fruits=["apples","mangoes","oranges",["pawpaws","pears"]]
#print(fruits[0])
#print(fruits[-1][-1])
#fruits.append(10)
#print(fruits)


#I also learnt and understood the differnt operators in python;
#Operators are special characters that tell the computer what to do with the values
#name = "jovita"
#Logic operators and their meaning
#arithmetic operators(+,-/,*//) perfoem arithmetic operations on numbers
#num1 = 100
#num2 = 200
#sum = num1 + num2
#print(sum)
    

#I learnt about floor division that when dealing with floor division it rounds off to an integer value
#for example;
#floordiv = num1 // num2
#print(floordiv)

#power/exp0nential
#print(num1**2)

#modulo (%) returns the remainder of one number divided by another
#print(num1  % num2)



#Assignment operators
#num3 = num1 + num2
#print(num1)
#this expression below changes the value of num1 from 100 to 102 starting from the line below,
#num1 += 2 #num = num1 + num2
#print(num1)
