#variable syntax for python(#represents a comment for readability)
#variable names should not start with special charcaters e.g(#number,@,$)
#variable names should not start with a numerical number,e.g(1number)
#however,number2 is valid syntax
#a variable name should not have spacese.g(my age,this is wrong)
#composite variable namesshould be separated by an underscore e.g(my_age)
#or youcan use camel-case notation e.g(myAge,myName)
#names should not start with capital letters unless they are functions or classes e.g(Myname)
#we should use relatable names e.g when dealing with a customer name,call them mycustomer,when dealing with numbers use num1,num2,num3)
#use shorter names e.g(cust for customer,num for number.age instead of my age,sal for salary)
#variable names should not be repeated in different forms because python is case sensitivee.g('Name' and 'name' are not the same)
age=23
name="jovita"
school="refactory"
print(school)
#declaring variables is a process of naming computer memory spaces.
#initialising a variable is the process of giving a variable a value e.g('age' is a variable,'26' is the value)
country="Uganda"
#the '=' sign is the assignment operator in programming language
